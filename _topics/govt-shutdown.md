# Introduction: What a federal shutdown means (in general)

When Congress fails to pass appropriations or a continuing resolution, many federal agencies cannot legally spend money and must curtail operations under the Antideficiency Act. Some programs - those funded by mandatory or permanent appropriations - are less vulnerable, while discretionary programs often face furlougs or service reductions.

Employees are broadly classified as:

- "Excepted" (or essential) workers who must continue some functions even though pay is not guaranteed during the shutdown.
- Non-excepted workers who are furloughed (i.e. sent home without pay) until funding is restored.

Since 2019, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act guarantees that federal workers (whether excepted or furloughed) will receive retroactive pay after a shutdown ends.

With that framework, here's how things might play out for Washington State residents.

# Health Programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and related services

## Medicare

- Because Medicare is funded by mandatory (rather than discretionary) provisions, benefits paymments (e.g. reimbursements to providers, Part B/Part D coverage) generally continue even during a shutdown.
- However, some auxiliary services may see disruptions:
    - Staffing at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) may be cut (e.g. customer service or administrative support) - around half of CMS employees might be furloughed.
    - Delays could occur for new card issuance, enrollment actions, audits, or rulemaking that is not "absolutely essential."
    - Telehealth waivers or extensions (for certain services) may expire if not extended - meaning some telehealth billing flexibility may be lost.

## Medicaid

- Medicaid is partially funded through federal funding but administered through states. Because state Medicaid spending is often considered essential, many core services continue.
- But challenges arise:
    - Federal oversight, audits, and some administrative support from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may be scaled back.
    - New enrollment, eligibility assistance, or appeals processes could slow if federal staffing or funding cuts impair operations.
    - Any state that relies heavily on federal grants or matching funds for expansions or supplemental programs may have to absorb costs temporarily or cut back.

In Washington State, which has expanded Medicaid and runs health benefit programs through state agencies, the state may need to fill gaps in administrative support if federal backstops weaken.

## Veterans Administration (VA) services

- Veterans' benefits (disability, pension, GI Bill, etc.) are financed through mandatory funding, so existing benefits and payments generally continue during a shutdown.
- Clinical services at VA hospitals and outpatient clinics are typically considered essential. Those operations normally continue, although nonurgent services or new initiatives may be delayed.
- Some administrative or support functions (e.g. new program rollouts, research, nonessential staff) may be scaled back.
- In Washington, veterans might see delays in elective procedures, slower approvals, or limited nonurgent services, depending on how deep staff reduction go at nearby VA facilities.

# Federal workers, contractors, and state/local ramifications

## Federal employees in Washington

- WasWashington State has many federal employees (in city, county, federal agencies, research institutions, satellites) who could be furloughed or required to work without pay, especially in agencies like the EPA, NOAA, USGS, Department of the Interior, etc.

- As noted above, the Fair Treatment Act ensures that after the shutdown ends, these workers will receive back pay. 

- But in the short term, furloughed workers must manage without pay, which may stress household budgets.

- Some contractors who depend on federal contracts could see work halted or payments delayed.

## Impact on state and local government

- State agencies may need to step in to backfill or maintain continuity of some functions: for example, public health, environmental monitoring, permitting, or park maintenance — to avoid public hazards or service gaps.

- The state might absorb increased labor or overtime costs.

- Revenue collections or federal grant disbursements (for infrastructure, education, social services) could slow, affecting budgeting and planning within the state.

- In Washington, this could stress state-run health, human services, or environmental oversight programs that coordinate with federal agencies.

## Military and defense

- Active-duty military personnel are considered essential and must continue operations even during a shutdown, though they may go without pay until funding resumes. 

- Reserve and National Guard members on active orders are also treated as essential. 

- Some base support services (e.g. morale, family programs, commissaries, child care) may be scaled back or curtailed depending on funding and staffing decisions. 

- Pentagon and major defense operations are often on multi-year or advance funding, so major readiness and deployment may be less vulnerable than smaller discretionary programs.

In Washington, with military installations, shipyards, aerospace contractors, or National Guard units, disruptions in support or civilian staffing could affect local economies or base-level services.

## Broader public impacts in Washington State

- **Delays in federal services**: passport processing, permits, environmental licenses, federal court operations — many of these may slow or stop, affecting businesses and individuals.

- **Travel, aviation, and safety**: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) services (air traffic control, safety inspections) are considered essential, though training or hiring could stop. Delays, staffing strain, or procedural slowdowns might ripple to Washington’s airports and air traffic.

- **Public health / inspections**: Some FDA, EPA, or food safety inspections may be suspended or scaled back, potentially affecting local food industries or environmental oversight.

- **Parks, recreation, and cultural sites**: National parks, monuments, or federal lands may close or drastically reduce services. In Washington, areas like national forests, parks, or federally managed recreation areas might see closures or reduced upkeep.

- **Economic shock**: Workers without pay reduce consumer spending, impacting local businesses. Contractors not being paid or new contracts delayed can ripple through supply chains.

- **Vulnerable populations**: Programs like WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) or child nutrition may suffer interruptions. Food assistance programs (SNAP) may continue short term but could be at risk in a long shutdown. 

- **Uncertainty / disruption costs**: Unpredictability in timing can deter investment, slow new projects, or create “hidden” costs (e.g. re-staffing, backlog clearing).

# In summary

A federal shutdown would not halt everything, but it would introduce friction and delays in many areas that Washington residents rely on: health and social programs might continue, but staffing and responsiveness could erode; veterans’ benefits and services would largely continue, though nonessential work may slow; federal workers and contractors in the state could face income disruption; state and local governments might need to absorb gaps; and military operations in Washington would persist but possibly with reduced support services.
