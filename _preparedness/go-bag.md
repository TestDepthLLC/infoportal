## Overview
As hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, mudslides and floods become mor common, people across the country are preparing by keeping a 
bag packed with what they'll need to grab if they must leave home in an emergency. It is recommended that each member of your
household have a go bag in the event you have to leave your home (whether due to wildfires, earthquake, civil unrest, or another
reason).

Here are important items to include:

1. **The bag**. Your carryall must be large and sturdy enough to hold the essentials and small enough to grab on the run. A backpack is a great
option. If you're not able to carry a heavy bag, consider a duffel on wheels.

2. **Food and water**. Add lightweight, nutrient-dense foods, such as protein bars, instant oatmeal, dried fruit, nuts and seeds, and at least one
gallon of water per person, per day. Don't forget a manual can opener and utility knife. A go bag should have enough food and water for at least
three days; remember to pack enough for your pets too.

3. **Personal essentials**. Purchase travel-size toiletries and a first aid kit. Pack a change of clothing, including a warm, waterproof layer, as well
as an extra pair of eyeglasses or contact lenses (and solution). Other items that should be in your go bag are an emergency blanket, scissors, duct
tape, work gloves, towers and matches, according to the American Red Cross.

4. **RSV, flu, and COVID-19 needs**. The lingering pandemic along with risks related to flu and RSV to older adults means that masks are an essential go
bag item; they can also be used to filter out ash from fires. However, be aware that only N95 masks will filter out fire particulates that could
trigger asthma or allergic responsses. Hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol, soap, antibackterial wipes, and a thermometer are
important too.

5. **Medications**. If there is a warning that you may be evacuated, call your pharmazy and request an extra medication refill. Pack a list of your medications
and the phone numbers for your pharmacy and physicians. You'll also need portable versions of specialized medical equipment, like syringes, CPAP machines
and oxygen tanks. If you have to evacuate without notice, the Rx Open website, in partnership with the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs,
maps the pharmacies that are open in disaster-stricken areas.

6. **Electronics**. Throw in extra phone chargers, a flashlight and batteries. The AARP recommends hand-crank portable radios. When all lines of communication
go down during a disaster, AM/FM radios have proven to be one of the most reliable sources of communication, and you don't need to worry about having fresh batteries.
You may want to preload apps such as the Red Cross app on your phone.

7. **Paperwork**. Make photocopies of essential documents, including passports; birth certificates; driver's licenses; Social Security and Medicare cards; marriage,
adoption, and naturalization certificates; title or lease documents; insurance paperwork; and credit and debit card information. Make sure to store these in a 
waterproof, zip-top bag. You can also upload insurance information and family photos to a digital vault. Just make sure you have a copy of your log in and password
information.

8. **Cash**. If natural disasters cause power outages, you may not be able to use your debit and credit cards to make purchases, so add cash to your go bad. The AARP
suggests about $200 for a two-member household to cover gas, food, and other last-minute essentials. A combination of small bills and rolls of quarters is ideal in
case you need to buy food or water from vending machines.

Keep your go bag in an accessible location, such as a front hall closet or garage, where it's easy to grab on your way out the door.
