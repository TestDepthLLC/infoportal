# How to Build a DIY First Aid Kit

This guide is sourced from U.S. News Health (https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/how-to-build-a-diy-first-aid-kit).

## Why You Should Create a DIY First Aid Kit

Although you can buy a ready-made first aid kit, there are a few reasons why you may want to create your own:

- **Health conditions:** If you or others in your family have conditions or diseases, like diabetes, your kit may need more first aid items. You will want supplies that address those conditions.

- **Extreme sports and activities:** You may want to customize your first aid kit based on where you'll use it. The items you have in a home first aid kit may be somewhat different than one that you take with you on a hike. Plus, if you participate in higher-risk activities, like mountain climbing, remote trail hiking, backcountry skiing or mountain biking, you will want to include extra supplies for more severe emergencies.

- **Personalized medicine:** Some people want to keep certain medications in your first aid kit that don't interfere with other medications that they use. Creating a kit for yourself ensures you have the right items and the right versions for you, for example if you can't take ibuprofen because of kidney disease, you can be sure your DIY kit acetaminophen instead.

Depending on the items you have in it, a DIY first aid kit can help treat a variety of health incidents, including:

- Allergic reactions
- Bleeding
- Blisters
- Bug bites
- Cuts and scrapes
- Diarrhea
- Headache
- Minor sprains

Some of these items may help an injury or health problem begin to heal. Others will provide just enough relief until health professionals can analyze it further.

There are several places where it's useful to have a DIY first aid kit:

- At home
- In a dorm room
- In your car of RV
- Inside a backpack or purse that you use often
- Attached to a bike, e-bike or other method of transportation

Having a first aid kit in these places can help you in variety of situations, including:

- In the event of a natural disaster or when you need to evacuate
- While playing sports or hiking
- While traveling

## Must Haves: Items to Have in a DIY First Aid Kit

As you build your DIY first aid kit, you'll want to have several basic items in it. Here's what you should make sure to include.

### Bandages

Include bandages of different sizes, at least four of each size. Small minor injuries are likely to happen frequently. Include different types of bandage and wraps, like:

- Adhesive bandages
- Gauze pads of various sizes
- Elastic wrap to wrap around a sprain or strain to lower swelling and give support to the injured area
- Triangular bandage, which can work as a sling for a hurt arm, wrist, or shoulder
- Moleskine or blister bandages

### Antibiotics and supplies

To clean an injury or wound and prevent infection, you'll need a few things:

- Antiseptic wipes
- Antibiotic spray or ointment
- Cotton applicators

### Tools

- Commercial tourniquet, which can slow severe bleeding
- Instant cold pack to numb the pain from a sprain or strain and reduce swelling
- Tweezers to remove a tick, splinter, glass, or other small items
- Small scissors for cutting bandages, strings, etc.
- Gloves, which are a barrier against bodily fluids and germs
- N95 masks

### Over-the-counter medications

Many first aid kits include over-the-counter medications, such as:

- Pain relievers, like Tylenol, Advil, and Excedrin
- Nondrowsy oral antihistamines
- Cough medicines
- Antacids
- Anti-diarrheal medicine
- Antihistamine cream for a bug bite, allergic reaction itch or inflammation
- Eye drops

### Important paperwork

It's helpful to have certain paperwork in your first aid kit, including:

- A printed list of medications that you use, including dosing and timing
- A copy of your health insurance card
- A list of health care providers you see regularly and their phone numbers

Take a picture of these items so you have them on your phone as well. These items are useful if you need to seek out further medical care.

### Medications used by your or loved ones

This is where first aid kit customization comes in handy. If you or someone you're with has severe allergies, then having an epinephrine pen in your kit is essential. The same applies if you're with someone who has diabetes and needs to have insulin in your kit.

If you don't have a need for emergency medication but you or someone you're with uses regular prescription medication, consider having a three- to seven-day supply of that medication in your kit.

### Naloxone (optional)

Naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdoses. Although not everyone will choose to have this type of medication in a first aid kit, it can be life-saving to have when needed.

## Putting Together Your DIY First Aid Kit

To put together your DIY first aid :

1. Keep the materials for your first aid kit in any original packaging, as needed to keep them sterile.
2. Choose an appropriate bag for your first aid kit. Depending on where you'll keep the bag, you could choose a durable, hard-shelled bag or something flexible. Aim for a lightweight option with several pockets. If the kit might get wet, make sure that it's waterproof.
3. Consider where your bag is being kept, and adjust its contents as needced. For a first aid kit that's staying in a car, you may want to reconsider keeping medications in it if you live in an area with extreme weather, as heat and cold can damage medications.
4. Do your best to keep items neatly in your kit. A disorganized first aid kit could cause you to lose valuable time in an emergency.

## Preparing to Use Your First Aid Kit

Having the best DIY first aid kit in the work means nothing if you're not prepared to use it. Consider taking a course on first aid from the Red Cross. The Red Cross also has an online course called Until Help Arrives (https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/first-aid-training/first-aid-classes/until-help-arrives).

## How to Maintain a First Aid Kit

Check your first aid kit after you've used it to assess what supplies need to be replenished.

If you haven't used it, plan to check it every six months. Look for any items like bandages or gauze pads that may be running low. Check medication expiration dates, so you can throw out what's expired and replace it with new medications. 

If you keep a list of your medications used in a first aid kit, update the list as you change medications.
