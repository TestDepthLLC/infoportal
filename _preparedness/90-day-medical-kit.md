# Introduction: Why a 90-Day Emergency Medical Supply Kit Matters

Natural disasters and civil emergencies can unfold suddenly, leaving communities isolated for days or even weeks. In Washington State, where rugged geography, dense population centers, and diverse hazards intersect, the ability to care for your own health during a crisis is more than a convenience—it can be lifesaving. A well-stocked 90-day medical supply kit ensures that you and your family can respond to injuries, treat common illnesses, and maintain essential health needs when professional medical help may be delayed or overwhelmed.

## Hazards Unique to Washington State

Washington’s natural landscape brings a variety of serious threats:

**Major Earthquakes and Tsunamis** – The Cascadia Subduction Zone and local faults pose a high risk of a large earthquake that could cut off access to hospitals and pharmacies for weeks.

**Volcanic Activity** – Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens remain active; ash fall or lahars could disrupt transportation and utilities.

**Severe Storms and Flooding** – Atmospheric river events and seasonal flooding can isolate communities, damage infrastructure, and contaminate drinking water.

**Wildfires and Smoke Events** – Increasingly intense wildfire seasons lead to poor air quality and respiratory distress far from the flames.

**Extended Power Outages** – Ice storms or windstorms can down power lines, making it difficult to refrigerate medications or access electronic medical records.

## The Current Climate of Political and Civil Unrest

Beyond natural hazards, today’s environment of political polarization and occasional civil unrest can strain emergency services. Protests, localized violence, or sudden disruptions to supply chains may cause pharmacies and clinics to close without warning. Access to routine prescriptions or urgent care could be limited just when they are most needed.

## Why Your Kit Should Be This Extensive

A 90-day kit is not simply about stocking a few first-aid basics; it is a deliberate buffer against uncertainty. The items listed—ranging from common pain relievers and antihistamines to trauma gear and medical reference guides—address three key needs:

**Continuity of Care**: If regular prescriptions or over-the-counter medications become scarce, you can manage chronic conditions and minor illnesses.

**Immediate Response to Injury**: Trauma supplies, splints, and hemostatic dressings give you the ability to stabilize injuries until professional help arrives.

**Self-Reliance in Prolonged Disruptions**: Printed medical guides and diagnostic tools support safe decision-making when medical professionals are unavailable.

Preparing such a comprehensive medical supply kit is an act of resilience. By anticipating the unique hazards of Washington State and acknowledging the uncertainties of our current social climate, you ensure that your household remains safe, healthy, and ready—no matter what unfolds.
