# Home Emergency Preparedness

This guide is a general approach to home emergency preparedness, keeping in mind the types of hazards that exist, you will want to research and tailor the response to your specific needs.

# Home Emergency Priorities: Air, Shelter, Water, Food

In most crises, your first actions should follow a simple rule of thumb - often called the **rule of 3s**. It's a guideline (not a guarantee) and varies with person, weather, and health, but it helps you focus when it matters.

| Need        |  Typical Limit                     |  Context                                                                                   |
|-------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clean Air   |  ~3 minutes without breathable air | Smoke, dust, or toxic gases can harm quickly. Prioritize breathing and indoor air quality. |
| Shelter/Warmth | ~3 hours without adequate shelter in cold/wet/windy conditions | Hypothermia or heat illness can develop fast. Microclimate matters |
| Water | ~3 days without water | Needs rise with heat and exertion; dehydration worsens decision-making. |
| Food | ~3 weeks without food | Most people have reserves; focus on water and heat first. |

**Note: These are rough guidelines for prioritization - always follow local emergency instructions.

## Priority #1: Clean Air

Wildfire smoke, dust storms, and chemical releases can make air unsafe. Aim to create a clean space and protect your lungs.

- Keep N95/KN95 respirators (snug fit; avoid exhalation valves for source control).
- Build or buy a HEPA air cleaner; DIY options like a Corsi-Rosenthal box are effective.
- Upgrade HVAC filter to MERV-13 (if your system supports it).
- Identify a clean room you can seal (close windows/doors; tape paper over obvious leaks).
- Stock spare filters and tape; monitor local air quality.
- Maintain working smoke and carbon-monoxide alarms; never run generators indoors.

Tip: During smoke events, run HEPA on high, keep doors/windows closed, and minimize indoor pollution (e.g., frying, candles).

## Priority #2: Shelter & Temperature

Staying warm and dry (or cool in heatwaves) prevents rapid decline. Create a safe microclimate.

- Insulate with layers, hats, socks; keep dry; use sleeping bags or emergency blankets.
- Zone heat one room (close doors, hang blankets); reduce drafts.
- Use indoor-safe heaters only; place CO detectors nearby and ventilate as the manual requires.
- Never use charcoal grills or camp stoves indoors; keep generators 20+ feet from openings.
- In heat: make a cool room with shade, cross-breeze, and fans; rest often and hydrate.

**Warning**: Carbon monoxide is odorless and deadly. If an alarm sounds, get fresh air immediately and call for help.

## Priority #3: Water

Plan at least 1 gallon (~3.8 L) per person per day for drinking and minimal hygiene; more for heat, exertion, or nursing.

- Store a base supply (bottles, 5-gal cans, or drums). Keep cool, out of sunlight; rotate periodically.
- Identify additional sources (water heater, melted ice, captured rain).
- Stock treatment options; boiling, filters rated for pathogens, or purification tablets.
- Boil water for 1 minute (or 3 minutes above ~6,500 feet) if safety is in doubt.
- Keep safe containers and a manual spigot/pump for larger drums.
- Consider filling bathtubs before disaster strikes if advanced warning is given (i.e. storms with power outages).

## Priority #4: Food

Focus on shelf-stable foods you already eat. Most people can tolerate short fasts, but energy and morale matter.

- Build a pantry of ready-to-eat and easy-to-cook items (canned proteins, beans, rice, oats, nut butters, shelf-stable milk).
- Include a manual can opener, spices, electrolytes, and comfort items.
- Plan simple cooking without grid power (outdoor grill, fuel canister stove).
- Rotate food via "first in, first out." Label with dates.
- Account for dietary needs, meds with food requirements, infants, and pets.

## General Prep Tips

- Copies of IDs, prescriptions, and contacts in a waterproof pouch; digital copies on an encrypted drive.
- Flashlights/headlamps + spare batters; battery bank and cables.
- Battery or hand-crank radio to receive official updates.
- First-aid kit and basic trainingl include needed medications.
- Cash in small bills; ATMs and card networks may be down.
- Family communication plan and meet-up point; designate an out-of-area contact.
- Pets: food, carrier, leash, vaccination record, extra meds.
- Practice: test your clean room, shut-off valves, and go-bags.
