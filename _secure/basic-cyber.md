# Cyber Hygiene Basics: Everyday Steps to Stay Safe Online

When we think about preparedness, most of us focus on food, water, and shelter. But in today’s world, protecting yourself online is just as important. Your phone, computer, and online accounts hold private details about your life — your conversations, finances, and plans. In times of political unrest or when facing an authoritarian government, those details could be used against you. Practicing **good “cyber hygiene”** — the digital equivalent of washing your hands — helps you reduce risks and keep control of your information.

Here are four simple but powerful steps you can take:

## Strong Passwords and Passphrases

A password is the first lock on your digital life. Unfortunately, many people use short, easy-to-guess passwords like 123456 or password. These are the equivalent of leaving your front door wide open.

**Tips for stronger protection:**

- Use long passphrases instead of short passwords. For example: PurpleRiver!Sunset$1985 is much stronger than Sunset85.

- The longer the phrase, the better. Aim for at least 12 characters.

- Don’t reuse the same password on multiple accounts. If one account gets hacked, the others could be too.

- A password manager (like Bitwarden or 1Password) can securely remember your passwords for you.

Think of your passphrase as the lock on your emergency supplies. You wouldn’t leave your prep gear where anyone could grab it — don’t leave your online accounts that way either.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Even the best password can be stolen. That’s why many services offer **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, sometimes called two-factor authentication. This adds an extra step after your password, usually a code sent to your phone or generated by an app.

**Why it matters:**

- If someone guesses or steals your password, they still can’t get in without the second factor.

- Think of it like a double-locked door: even if a thief picks one lock, the second one slows them down.

**How to set it up:**

- Look in your account settings for “Security” or “Two-Factor Authentication.”

- Use an authenticator app (like Authy or Google Authenticator) instead of text messages when possible, since texts can sometimes be intercepted.

## Software Updates and Patching

It’s tempting to ignore those constant “Update Available” messages, but updates are not just about new features. Most updates fix **security holes** that hackers and governments alike could use to break into your device.

**Best practices:**

- Turn on automatic updates for your phone and computer.

- Update apps as soon as updates are available, especially web browsers and messaging apps.

- If an app no longer receives updates, consider replacing it with one that does.

Think of updates like repairing a hole in your roof — the longer you wait, the more water leaks in.

## Safe Browsing Practices

Many cyber threats come not from hacking your computer directly, but from tricking you into handing over your information. Fake websites, suspicious links, and phishing emails are the digital version of someone pretending to be a friendly neighbor in order to rob you.

**Tips for safe browsing:**

- Don’t click links in emails or messages unless you’re sure they’re legitimate. When in doubt, type the web address directly into your browser.

- Look for “https://” at the start of web addresses — this means the site is using a secure connection.

- Be cautious when downloading files. Malicious attachments are one of the easiest ways attackers spread malware.

- Use a privacy-respecting browser (like Firefox or Brave) and consider adding security extensions like uBlock Origin.

## Why This Matters in Times of Crisis

Authoritarian governments and bad actors often use digital surveillance and online tricks to keep tabs on people. Practicing these basics means:

- Your private messages stay private.

- Your accounts are less likely to be hijacked.

- You can continue to safely organize, communicate, and prepare without drawing unnecessary attention.

Just like food storage and first aid, **cyber hygiene is a form of resilience**. By taking these steps now, you’re not just protecting your data — you’re protecting your freedom to communicate and act when it matters most.
